# sequoiaExtra

This is a collection of R functions associated with R package sequoia. 

They are (currently) not included in the package because their use cases are too
rare, or because they are still too experimental. 

Use with caution, as they do not include input checks yet. 

Feedback and feature requests are very welcome! Or if you'd like to share some of
your own sequoia-related functions here, please do contact me!
